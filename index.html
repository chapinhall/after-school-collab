          <h1>Chapin Hall Collaborative</h1>
          <h4>Connecting organizations to data and analysis to improve youth development</h4>
          In cooperation with large non-profit organizations (NPO) and public agencies, Chapin Hall has organized this project to study where and how youth support service programs (YSS) are positively impacting youth development. Data on youth program enrollment and attendance from NPOs are merged with public agency data through relationships and Master Data Sharing Agreements (MDSAs) built by Chapin Hall. This creates a contextual backdrop for youth academic, social, and behavioral trajectories coming into, during, and following engagement in YSS programs.

          <h3>Our current organizational partners</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago</li>
            <li>Children's Home and Aid</li>
            <li>After School Matters</li>
            <li>UCAN</li>
            <li>Chicago Public Libraries</li>
            <li>Chicago Housing Authority</li>
            <li>Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago</li>
          </ul>

          <!--Could enter the table of partner logos here
          See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table as one type of reference.-->

          <h3>Current agency partners contributing data</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Chicago Public Schools</li>
            <li>Illinois Department of Child and Family Services</li>
          </ul>
          Because the data on youth characteristics and outcomes are strongly protected by privacy laws, this repository stores only the code used to analyze and create reports based off of the data. In the future, a mock data set with the features of the real data set may be posted to allow collaborators to develop code to contribute to the project.
